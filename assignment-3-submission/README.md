## Group Programming Assignment 3
There are 13 test programs for the memory usage test. All run at once, so just run the single program.

### Build & Run Instructions
Simply build the xv-6 repository with the following command:
```
$ make
```

After it builds, make and start the emulator by typing in:
```
$ make qemu-nox
```

This should now open the ```CS450$ ``` prompt to type in commands.

Verify the test program ```memTest``` shows up when you `ls`

Run the ```memTest``` test program with the following command:
```
CS450$ memTest
```
